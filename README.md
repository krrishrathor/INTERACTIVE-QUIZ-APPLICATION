*DESCRIPTION*:
*About the Project*

This is a beginner-friendly yet aesthetically polished Quiz Application built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate front-end development capabilities using core web technologies without relying on any frameworks or libraries. It showcases the practical understanding of working with APIs, DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and user interaction ‚Äî all within a clean, responsive, and visually pleasing interface.

The application dynamically fetches multiple-choice questions using the Open Trivia Database API (OpenTDB), enabling a fresh set of questions with each session. The quiz allows users to answer one question at a time, receive immediate feedback on their selections (correct/wrong), see their score update in real-time, view progress via an animated progress bar, and finally restart the quiz after completion ‚Äî making it an end-to-end self-contained quiz engine.

*Tools & Technologies Used*

This project was built using the following tools:

    HTML5: The structure of the app, including semantic elements and component layout.

    CSS3: Styling the interface with a custom pastel + glassmorphic theme. Flexbox and transitions were used for layout and animation.

    JavaScript (Vanilla): Handles logic like fetching questions, checking answers, updating score/progress, and restarting the quiz.

    REST API: Questions are loaded dynamically via the https://opentdb.com/api.php endpoint.

    Text Editor: The project was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular code editor that supports web development with built-in syntax highlighting, Live Server, and extensions like Prettier and GitHub integration.
